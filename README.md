 Project Title:
Stock Price Prediction Using Stacked LSTM

Description:
Stock values is very valuable but extremely hard to predict correctly for any human being on their own. This project seeks to solve the problem of Stock Prices Prediction by utilizes Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm, to predict future stock values.  

Aim/Objective:
 The objective of the proposed work is to study and improve the supervised learning algorithms to predict the stock price.
